# Notes

- App is an extremely basic maven app (see src)
- Pipeline is intended to run on an agent with maven + helm + docker installed
- Deployment is intended to be to a kubernetes cluster via helm. Further configuration would need to be done on the Jenkins side to completely set up the connection
